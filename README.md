This batch script allows you to either download the latest version of [NetLimiter](https://www.netlimiter.com/) by **Locktime Software** and patch it, or simply patch the version that you already have installed, if compatible.

The script downloads the original installer and the patched DLL, from the original website and from this repo respectively, and patches the software by simply swapping the original DLL with the modified one.
